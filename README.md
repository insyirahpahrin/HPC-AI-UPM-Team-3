# Project Description
Our project for the APAC HPC AI Competition 2024 focuses on the integration and optimization of HOOMD-blue and LLaMA2 LitGPT on the NCI and NSCC SG supercomputers.

# Objectives
The objective is to leverage these advanced computational tools and high-performance computing resources to solve complex problems in molecular dynamics and natural language processing efficiently, with a primary focus on achieving maximum optimization.

# Methodology
[HOOMD Blue]
* Calculate efficiency using total cores and speedup.
* Try allocating different cores and nodes to increase the number of steps.
* Result: Comparison on different number of nodes.

[Llama2]
* Optimization on MPI communication settings.
* Result: Comparison on training time.
  
#
Programming Languages: Python
HPC Resources: Gadi HPC system, Aspire2U NSCC

# Results
[HOOMD Blue]
* Steps per second increased when more nodes and cores are used. This reflects on the improved performance with additional computational resources
* 

# Challenges
Discuss any challenges or obstacles faced during the project and how they were addressed.

# Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and outcomes of your project.
